========================

My first adventure with really investing in making.  I hope to make a CNC machine to help me and my neighbors make things.  I'm mostly just copying all you smart people.  I hope to be able to attach all kinds of different things to the Z axis, like a magnifying glass, router, laser, drill, clay extruder, etc.
